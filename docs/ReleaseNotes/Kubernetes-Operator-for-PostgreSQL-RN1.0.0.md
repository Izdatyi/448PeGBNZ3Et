**Percona announces the general availability of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL Operator 1.0.0.**

The Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL Operator automates the lifecycle, simplifies deploying and managing open source PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes.

The Operator follows best practices for configuration and setup of the [Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL](https://www.percona.com/doc/postgresql/LATEST/index.html). The Operator provides a consistent way to package, deploy, manage, and perform a backup and a restore for a Kubernetes application. Operators deliver automation advantages in cloud-native applications.

The advantages are the following:


* Deploy a Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL with no single point of failure
and environment which can span multiple availability zones


* Modify the Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL size parameter to add or remove
PostgreSQL instances


* Use single Custom Resource as a universal entry point to configure the
cluster, similar to other Percona Operators


* Carry on semi-automatic upgrades of the Operator and PostgreSQL to newer
versions


* Integrate with Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) to seamlessly monitor
your Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL


* Automate backups or perform on-demand backups as needed with support for
performing an automatic restore


* Use cloud storage with S3-compatible APIs or Google Cloud for backups


* Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for the replication and client traffic


* Support advanced Kubernetes features such as pod disruption budgets, node
selector, constraints, tolerations, priority classes, and
affinity/anti-affinity

Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL Operator is based on [Postgres Operator](https://crunchydata.github.io/postgres-operator/latest/) developed by Crunchy Data.

## Release Highlights


* It is now possible to [configure scheduled backups](../backups.md#backups-scheduled)
following the declarative approach in the `deploy/cr.yaml` file, similar to
other Percona Kubernetes Operators


* OpenShift compatibility allows [running Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform](../openshift.md#install-openshift)


* For the first time, the main functionality of the Operator is covered by
functional tests, which ensure the overall quality and stability

## New Features and Improvements


* {{ k8spgjira(96) }}: PMM Client container does not cause the crash of the
whole database Pod if `pmm-agent` is not working properly


* {{ k8spgjira(86) }}: The Operator [is now compatible](../openshift.md#install-openshift)
with the OpenShift platform


* {{ k8spgjira(62) }}: Configuring [scheduled backups](../backups.md#backups-scheduled)
through the main Custom Resource is now supported


* {{ k8spgjira(99) }}, {{ k8spgjira(131) }}: The Operator documentation was
substantially improved, and now it covers among other things the usage of
Transport Layer Security (TLS) for internal and external communications, and
cluster upgrades

## Supported Platforms

The following platforms were tested and are officially supported by Operator
1.0.0:


* [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) 4.6 - 4.8


* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 1.17 - 1.21


* [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com) 1.21

This list only includes the platforms that the Operator is specifically tested
on as a part of the release process. Other Kubernetes flavors and versions
depend on the backward compatibility offered by Kubernetes itself.
