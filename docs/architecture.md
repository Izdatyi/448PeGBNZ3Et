# Design overview

The Percona Operator for PostgreSQL automates and simplifies
deploying and managing open source PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes.
The Operator is based on [CrunchyDataâ€™s PostgreSQL Operator](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v4/).

PostgreSQL containers deployed with the Operator include the following components:


* The [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database management system, including:


    * [PostgreSQL Additional Supplied Modules](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/contrib.html),


    * [pgAudit](https://www.pgaudit.org/) PostgreSQL auditing extension,


    * [PostgreSQL set_user Extension Module](https://github.com/pgaudit/set_user),


    * [wal2json output plugin](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json),


* The [pgBackRest](https://pgbackrest.org/) Backup & Restore utility,


* The [pgBouncer](http://pgbouncer.github.io/) connection pooler for PostgreSQL,


* The PostgreSQL high-availability implementation based on the [Patroni template](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/),


* the [pg_stat_monitor](https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor/) PostgreSQL Query Performance Monitoring utility,


* LLVM (for JIT compilation).

To provide high availability the Operator involves [node affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity)
to run PostgreSQL Cluster instances on separate worker nodes if possible. If
some node fails, the Pod with it is automatically re-created on another node.

To provide data storage for stateful applications, Kubernetes uses
Persistent Volumes. A *PersistentVolumeClaim* (PVC) is used to implement
the automatic storage provisioning to pods. If a failure occurs, the
Container Storage Interface (CSI) should be able to re-mount storage on
a different node.

The Operator functionality extends the Kubernetes API with [Custom Resources
Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions).
These CRDs provide extensions to the Kubernetes API, and, in the case of the
Operator, allow you to perform actions such as creating a PostgreSQL Cluster,
updating PostgreSQL Cluster resource allocations, adding additional utilities to
a PostgreSQL cluster, e.g. [pgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) for
connection pooling and more.

When a new Custom Resource is created or an existing one undergoes some changes
or deletion, the Operator automatically creates/changes/deletes all needed
Kubernetes objects with the appropriate settings to provide a proper Percona
PostgreSQL Cluster operation.

Following CRDs are created while the Operator installation:


* `pgclusters` stores information required to manage a PostgreSQL cluster.
This includes things like the cluster name, what storage and resource classes
to use, which version of PostgreSQL to run, information about how to maintain
a high-availability cluster, etc.


* `pgreplicas` stores information required to manage the replicas within a
PostgreSQL cluster. This includes things like the number of replicas, what
storage and resource classes to use, special affinity rules, etc.


* `pgtasks` is a general purpose CRD that accepts a type of task that is
needed to run against a cluster (e.g. take a backup) and tracks the state of
said task through its workflow.
